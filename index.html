                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>What is Pathway Commons?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pathway Commons is a collection of publicly available pathways from multiple organisms.
                        It provides researchers with convenient access to a comprehensive collection of pathways from
                        multiple sources represented in a common language. Access is via a web portal for browsing,
                        query and download. Database providers can share their pathway data via a common repository
                        and avoid duplication and reduce software development costs. Bioinformatics software developers
                        can increase efficiency by sharing software components.  Pathways include biochemical reactions,
                        complex assembly, transport and catalysis events, and physical interactions involving proteins, DNA,
                        RNA, small molecules and complexes.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Is Pathway Commons free?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, it's free! Pathway Commons distributes pathway content with the intellectual
                        property restrictions of the source database.  However, only databases that are freely available
                        or free to academics are included.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Does Pathway Commons compete with other pathway databases?</h4>
                    <p>
                        No. Pathway Commons does not compete with or duplicate efforts of pathway databases or
                        software tool providers. Pathway Commons will add value to these existing efforts by providing
                        a shared resource for publishing, distributing and querying pathway information. Existing
                        database groups will provide pathway curation, Pathway Commons will provide a mechanism and
                        the technology for sharing. A vital aspect of Pathway Commons is clear author attribution.
                        Curation teams at existing databases must be supported as much as possible by researchers to
                        ensure they can keep performing their valuable work.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>What are the future plans for Pathway Commons?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Pathway Commons work group will provide software systems to collect, store and integrate
                        pathway data from database groups, with clear author attribution; store, validate, index and
                        maintain the information to enable efficient, maximum quality access; distribute pathway
                        information to the scientific public; and, provide a basic set of end user software for
                        browsing and analysis.  We will be adding more databases over time. Pathway Commons will also
                        support additional types
                        of pathway data, such as gene regulation, molecular states and genetic interactions as
                        these features are added to BioPAX.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>What is BioPAX?</h4>
                    <p>
                        BioPAX, or Biological Pathway Exchange, is a standard exchange format for biological pathways.
                        Pathway databases that make their data available in this format can be imported into Pathway Commons.
                        BioPAX is developed through a collaborative effort by many pathway databases.
                        More information is available at <a href="http://biopax.org">http://biopax.org</a>.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>What will Pathway Commons not do?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pathway Commons will not duplicate advanced features of source databases that are
                        often optimized for the type of data and users specific to a source database. Examples
                        include pathway visualization, certain advanced queries and all types of analysis tools.
                        Users are encouraged to explore these features by following hyperlinks from Pathway
                        Commons.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>What can I do with this information?</h4>
                    <p>
                        You can browse available pathway information and answer questions such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What proteins interact with my favorite protein?</li>
                        <li>What pathways involve my favorite protein?</li>
                        <li>Is my favorite protein involved in transport events or biochemical reactions?</li>
                        <li>What enzymes use my favorite metabolite as a substrate?</li>
                        <li>And many more...</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>How were the pathways collected?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pathways were downloaded directly from source databases. Each source pathway database has
                        been created differently, some by manual extraction of pathway information from the literature
                        and some by computational prediction. Pathway Commons provides a filtering mechanism to allow
                        the user to view only chosen subsets of information, such as only the manually curated subset.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>What kind of information is part of each pathway?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pathways from different databases are defined by different levels of detail. Details that
                        may be included are proteins, small molecules, DNA, RNA, complexes and their cellular locations,
                        different types of physical interactions, such as molecular interaction, biochemical reaction,
                        catalysis, complex assembly and transport, post-translational protein modifications, original
                        citations, experimental evidence and links to other databases e.g. of protein sequence annotation.
                        Some information is only available in the downloaded BioPAX files.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>How good is the quality of Pathway Commons?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The quality of Pathway Commons pathways is dependent on the quality of the pathways from
                        source databases. Pathway Commons allows users to filter data by various criteria, including
                        data source, which should allow viewing a restricted subset of high quality data. In the future,
                        Pathway Commons will implement published algorithms to automatically assess data quality and allow
                        this as an additional filter.
