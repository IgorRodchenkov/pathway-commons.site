# Overview
Detailed and comprehensive pathway information is a key element for understanding human genetic variation and disease and will enable genomic medicine to move towards diagnosis and therapy in a patient-specific context. Large data initiatives at the NIH and in the health care community can leverage the vast biological knowledge captured in pathways resources to better organize and analyze their data.

Pathway Commons is a convenient single point of access for all publicly accessible pathway information based on the BioPAX standard language. In increasingly close coordination with database teams and NHGRI staff, we aim to provide for the efficient exchange of pathway data; aggregation and integration into a shared public information store; distribution in a value-added form as aggregated data sets and as context-tailored data feeds; and availability to the end-user in the context of domain-specific portals, such as genetics, genomics, personalized medicine, model organism and bioinformatics web portals, exploiting advanced internet web service technology.
